# 7TV for youtube comments
This is only a **concept idea** of how could emotes be added to youtube comments.

Thanks for considering it!
## How to use

- Download this repository and put it into a folder
- Open your browser and open your extensions page to add the extension
- Open Youtube video with comments containing the word **WHAT** or **om**

> [!TIP]
> I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHxi5_yDeYg) to test the extension
> Look for comments of creator(WHAT emote) and Igrolodz(om emote)
